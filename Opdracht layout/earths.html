                <h2 class="description">For centuries, humans have wondered whether Earth is unique in the universe, or if similar planets exist out there. Even a decade ago, we still did not know. But then NASA's Kepler Space Telescope made discoveries that changed everything. Thanks to that important mission, the answer became clear: other planets like ours are out in the cosmos. We just haven't seen one with our own eyes yet.</h2>

                <h1>How did the kepler telescope find evidence?</h1>
                <br> 
                <h2 class="description">Since its 2009 launch, Kepler has discovered more than 2,000 confirmed exoplanets and has given us a huge amount of information about their orbits and sizes. The planets found range greatly in their masses, composition and orbital distances: for instance, enormous gas giants orbiting incredibly close to their stars, called hot Jupiters; planets that orbit two stars, called circumbinary planets; and rocky planets with the potential to be like Earth.</h2>

                <br> 
                <h2 class="description">Kepler showed us these planets are common in the universe. In fact, we now know there are more potentially habitable planets in our galaxy alone than there are people alive on Earth. One out of every two sun-like stars you see in the night sky has a rocky, Earth-like planet in its habitable zone.</h2>
